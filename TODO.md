TODO
====

* RGN file support
* convert between RGN and GCD
* Express-like updater
  * should be text interface or ncurses
  * detect Garmin MTP devices or /GARMIN directory in mounted roots
    * MTP support: https://github.com/wangjiezhe/pymtp
  * fetch GarminDevice.xml
  * upload to Express, list returned files
  * ask user, then download files and push to device
  * maybe: support for additional downloads (languages, icons, etc.)
  * maybe: support for running under Windows (although there you have the real Express)
